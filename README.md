- The animation is generated by PyTTI (Python Text to Image), a machine learning diffusion model developed by sportsracer48 and David Marx (DigThatData).
- The model uses top trending search terms throughout the week as the text inputs for the model.
- The search terms are retrieved using PyTrends, an unofficial API for Google Trends.

## Planned Updates
- Automate PyTTI model to run weekly.
- Update directory structure to upload new animations automatically.
- Add section for older videos to be archived and accessed.
